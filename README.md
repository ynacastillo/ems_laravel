It gives administrators with a consolidated dashboard for effectively monitoring employee attendance, timetables, and general workforce performance. It serves as a comprehensive platform that enables HR departments and managers to efficiently manage various functions, including employee attendance, punctuality, and scheduling information, allowing administrators to monitor workforce behavior, identify concerns, and effectively optimize scheduling and HR management operations.
